## Toshokan: E-commerce platform for ebooks (Personal Project)

**Toshokan (å›³æ›¸é¤¨)**, meaning "library" in Japanese, is a personal project aiming to build an online platform for buying and downloading ebooks.

**Note:** This project is under-development, if you find issues in the README.md file, please do not worry those errors will be fixed soon

### Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Flask (Python web framework)
* **Frontend:**
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
    * Bootstrap (CSS framework)

### Features

* **User-friendly Interface:** Toshokan strives for a clean and intuitive design for browsing, searching, and purchasing ebooks.
* **E-book Library:** Secure storage and management of ebooks in various formats (implementation details to be determined).
* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Secure transactions through a trusted payment gateway (to be chosen during development).
* **User Accounts:** Users can create accounts to manage purchase history, create wishlists, and potentially access an e-reader functionality for reading ebooks within the platform (to be implemented in future phases).

**Current Development Stage:**

This project is currently in its initial stages. The core functionalities like user interface, user authentication, and basic product browsing are being prioritized.

### Future Considerations

* **Author Section:** Integration for independent authors to upload ebooks, manage pricing, and track sales (potential future feature).
